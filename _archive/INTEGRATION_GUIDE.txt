dpow.chat Core v2 - Integration Complete

The chat system now uses a simplified OpenAI endpoint at /api/chat

WHAT WAS CHANGED:
1. Created new /app/api/chat/route.ts - Clean OpenAI GPT-4o-mini endpoint
2. Updated ChatDrawer.tsx - Now calls /api/chat instead of /api/whatsapp-webhook
3. System works with existing Excel upload functionality
4. Persistent chat drawer remains functional

CURRENT FUNCTIONALITY:
- Upload Excel files via the landing page
- Click chat icon to open persistent drawer
- Ask questions and receive AI responses
- File status tracking shows uploaded data

NO CHANGES NEEDED TO:
- Landing page design (app/page.tsx)
- Excel upload flow
- VoiceInput component
- ChatBubble, ChatInput components
- Any UI styling

The system is production-ready and the build passes successfully.
